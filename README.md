# Transportation Problem Solver by PDC

This project provides a complete implementation of the **Transportation Problem** using Python. It includes tools for reading input data manually or from Excel, generating an initial feasible solution using the **North-West Corner Rule**, optimizing the solution, and visualizing the optimization path.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── InputData.py          # Manually input demands, supplies, and costs
├── InputFromExcel.py     # Extracts data from Excel file (path input from keyboard)
├── NorthWestCorner.py    # Generates initial solution using North-West Corner method
├── Optimize.py           # Optimizes the transportation plan
├── PathFinder.py         # Builds an optimization path from the current plan
├── main.py               # Entry point of the program
├── input.xlsx            # Sample input form
```

## How to Run

1. **Install required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install openpyxl 
   ```

2. **Run the main script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Choose Input Mode:**
   - **Manual Input**: Uses logic from `InputData.py`
   - **Excel Input**: Enter Excel file path when prompted (uses `InputFromExcel.py`)
